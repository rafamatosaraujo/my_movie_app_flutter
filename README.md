# my_movie_app

This a demo app to study Flutter development and arquitecture.

The idea is to build the same application with different libraries and architectures to test the development experience and benefits of each approach.

For this purpose, each branch will follow one implementation.

## The app

**MyMovies** is a simple app where you can browse, comment on, rate and favorite movies.
[The movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) will be used as datasorce, so if you want to clone the repo and try it on your local enviroment, you will need to get an API key.
